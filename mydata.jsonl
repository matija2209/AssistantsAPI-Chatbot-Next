About me
Hello 👋 I'm Katharina Pilz, the founder of WHCP. You'll often find me wearing multiple hats, whether it's designing eye-catching products, managing exciting projects, or diving into marketing and sales. My mission is simple: I want to help businesses work better with the right technology. Lately, I've been dipping my toes into the coding world and working on some fascinating AI projects. But I'm not all about work. When I'm not lending a hand to other businesses or immersed in our own AI Micro SaaS projects, you'll find me dominating the beach volleyball court with my competitive edge or soaking up the sun with a hot cup of coffee in hand. Looking for a digital boost for your business? Let's connect and make it happen!
